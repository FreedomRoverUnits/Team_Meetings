- start on this tutorial first : gpio, timers?, pwm all for the motor_driver
  -- https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.3/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/timer.html
- pre-Assembly rover 
	- have rover chassis built
  - brittney will talk with librarian regarding this (I did and we have our first rover built)
- Discuss library regarding microROS
- Read through Datasheet for esp32
- share tutorials and knowledge
- share information regarding lidar libraries for microRos
- getting pwm to work with motor driver
- to start seeting up pid control with rotarty encoders
  - goal is to have pid somewhat working by the end of August (still in progress)
- Try to assembly the entire rover to get a feel/understanding of how everything will look together (Saturday)
- update the website (bri and misi)
	- update component pics with our own pics
	- add team meeting notes as well
- read a section of ros 2 documentation (jordy, misi, bri)

NOTES: 
Notes on different stages in our project: 
  - First stage: Rover itself
    - being able to communicate with all the components on an esp32 and using microRos todo so
  - Second stage: Rover communicating with (local) Server
    - rover is able to communicate to with server and server is able to communicate back to rover
  - Third stage: Server sending Task to Rover
    - server instructs rovers on a (single) task
    - Note: Stretch goal: have a user communicate with the server to do a task
  - Fourth  stage: Server is able to communicate with multiple rovers
    - Server is sending packets to rovers and managing all that information same with rovers sending packets to Server.
