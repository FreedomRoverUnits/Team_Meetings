NOTES: 
Notes on different stages in our project: 
  - First stage: Rover itself
    - being able to communicate with all the components on an esp32 and using microRos todo so
  - Second stage: Rover communicating with (local) Server
    - rover is able to communicate to with server and server is able to communicate back to rover
  - Third stage: Server sending Task to Rover
    - server instructs rovers on a (single) task
    - Note: Stretch goal: have a user communicate with the server to do a task
  - Fourth  stage: Server is able to communicate with multiple rovers
    - Server is sending packets to rovers and managing all that information same with rovers sending packets to Server.

GOALS:
Goal for August or when schools starts:
  - have the rover individually working 
    - misi will be very happy
Goal for next week: 
  - tutorial for encoder
    - keep track of : 1. how much time has past , 2. counting 
    - interrupt: when it goes high 
  - Testing the router without internet:
  - test all the components to make sure they all work.
    - this means we need to solder all our components we will be using or at least have everything with us to do so.
Goal for today:
  - get incontact with jordy!!!! (ASAP)
  - Find and post images of project nodes for entire system
