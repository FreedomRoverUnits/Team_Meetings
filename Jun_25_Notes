Team Meeting Notes for June 22, 2023

Topics:

TODO by Wednesday meeting: 
- Flash one rasberry pico with microros
- Have arduino code for lidar testing
	-- use arduino tutorial for rx/tx and build from that.
- Soldering components rasberry pico
- RLC/RCLC studying more on this to debug line code for microRos 
- Solder lidar wires to larger wires for better connection
- setup ssh through differen networks (brit and misi) (VPN setup, looking into this more )
	-- https://askubuntu.com/questions/749230/is-it-possible-to-ssh-between-two-different-network 
	-- https://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/ 
- read a section of ros 2 documentation (jordy, misi, bri)
	-- https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html

TODO during Wednesday meeting:
- Flash second rasberry pico with arduino to test lidar
- Getting done with the arduino tutorial for lidar

TODO through the Week: 
- Try to assembly the entire rover to get a feel/understanding of how everything will look together (friday)
	-- bring hotglue gun (maybe)
- update the website (bri and misi)
	- update component pics with our own pics
	- add team meeting notes as well
	- add summary of may notes


Final Descision: 
- Decided to use kabob sticks and hotglue to secure rods on prototype of rover

NOTES: 
JULY goal is to create a library with function calls for our sensors
August goal - TBA

In charge of components:
Brittney - lidar
Misi - IMU and accelorator 
Jordy - PID encoder


Findings:
- find screw size for 3d print
	* I found that #3 screw and #4 work (haven't tested it yet), just with measurement taking. 
  However none of the screws available online have a length of more than an 1in, which leaves us with a small space to work with if we want to layer on top. 
  So my suggestion is to either make the holes individually larger with a soldering kit or we use wooden sticks like kabob sticks and use hot glue to secure it in place,
  this also helps avoiding shorts we could get with the metal screws. 
  I have also looked into bolts however it seems that the diameter of 3mm or 1/10" is too small and not commercialized and not available to use at the moment.
