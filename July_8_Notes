	- also review code from discord by jordy
- pre-Assembly rover
- Ask jordy regarding PID
- Discuss library regarding microROS
- Rewire Lidar's (ask jordy for his Lidar)
- Ask Jordy for all the componets 
-

TODO during Wednesday meeting:
- test out preassembled rover and suggest fixes
- order more 3-d part for rover
	- KEARNS : main1v2 at 100%
	- Hunter:
		- part13 in different sizes: 120%, 130%, 140%, 150% 160%
		- part2 at 100% (2)

- sharing information regarding how to flash microRos on esp32, and if we need the full colcon library
- share information regarding lidar libraries for microRos

TODO through the Week: 
- Try to assembly the entire rover to get a feel/understanding of how everything will look together (friday)
	-- bring hotglue gun (maybe)
- update the website (bri and misi)
	- update component pics with our own pics
	- add team meeting notes as well
	- add summary of may notes

NOTES: 
We got the second rasberry pico to work with the lidar, re-soldering did the trick.

JULY goal is to create a library with function calls for our sensors
August goal - TBA

In charge of components:
Brittney - lidar
Misi - IMU and accelorator 
Jordy - PID encoder
