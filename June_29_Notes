Team Meeting Notes for June 29, 2023

Topics:

TODO by Wednesday meeting: 
- Have arduino code for lidar testing
	-- use arduino tutorial for rx/tx and build from that.
- Soldering components rasberry pico (redo)
- RLC/RCLC studying more on this to debug line code for microRos (esp32)
- setup ssh through differen networks (brit and misi) (VPN setup, looking into this more )
	-- https://askubuntu.com/questions/749230/is-it-possible-to-ssh-between-two-different-network 
	-- https://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/ 
- read a section of ros 2 documentation (jordy, misi, bri)
	-- https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html

TODO during Wednesday meeting:
- Flash second rasberry pico with arduino to test lidar (didn't work, have )
- Getting done with the arduino tutorial for lidar (never worked, having issues with interfacing and communication)

TODO through the Week: 
- Try to assembly the entire rover to get a feel/understanding of how everything will look together (friday)
	-- bring hotglue gun (maybe)
- update the website (bri and misi)
	- update component pics with our own pics
	- add team meeting notes as well
	- add summary of may notes


Final Descision: 
- Decided to use kabob sticks and hotglue to secure rods on prototype of rover


NOTES: 
Running into to many issues with testing the lidar individually, getting no data from the lidar.

JULY goal is to create a library with function calls for our sensors
August goal - TBA

In charge of components:
Brittney - lidar
Misi - IMU and accelorator 
Jordy - PID encoder
