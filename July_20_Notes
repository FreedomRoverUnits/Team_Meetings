Team Meeting Notes for July 20, 2023

Topics:
Verbal Discussion: 
- Make a generic microRos appliction
  - gpio: setting on and off
    - device : motor bridge
    - device : rotary encoder
  - Timers: 
    - usage on : PID and/or creating a PWM
  - I2C : 
    - device: IMU
  - uart: 
    - device: Lidar
  - Publisher/Subcriber nodes of MicroRos
    - Notes: look into finding tutorial on how this works 
  - interrupts: 
    - device : rotarty encoders
  
- Review the datasheet for esp32 as they might have different address, etc.
  - misi sent datasheets to me on discord
- Find and post images of project nodes for entire system
Notes on different stages in our project: 
  - First stage: Rover itself
    - being able to communicate with all the components on an esp32 and using microRos todo so
  - Second stage: Rover communicating with (local) Server
    - rover is able to communicate to with server and server is able to communicate back to rover
  - Third stage: Server sending Task to Rover
    - server instructs rovers on a (single) task
    - Note: Stretch goal: have a user communicate with the server to do a task
  - Fourth  stage: Server is able to communicate with multiple rovers
    - Server is sending packets to rovers and managing all that information same with rovers sending packets to Server.

Goal for August or when schools starts:
  - have the rover individually working 
    - misi will be very happy
Goal for next week: 
  - tutorial for encoder
    - keep track of : 1. how much time has past , 2. counting 
    - interrupt: when it goes high 
  - Testing the router without internet:
  - test all the components to make sure they all work.
    - this means we need to solder all our components we will be using or at least have everything with us to do so.
Goal for today:
  - get incontact with jordy!!!! (ASAP)
  - Find and post images of project nodes for entire system


TODO by Saturday meeting: 
- Have tutorials for a generic microRos application (look above for what we need)
- Review code for lidar and libraries to start to code our own library for our project. (brittney)
	- also review code from discord by jordy
- pre-Assembly rover 
	- have rover chassis built
- Discuss library regarding microROS
- Read through Datasheet for esp32
- Setup microsoft laptop linux (brittney)
- read a section of ros 2 documentation (jordy, misi, bri)
	-- https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html
- attempt to flash microRos to raspberry pico (Brittney)
- setup ssh through differen networks (brit and misi) (VPN setup, looking into this more )
	-- https://askubuntu.com/questions/749230/is-it-possible-to-ssh-between-two-different-network 
	-- https://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/ 

TODO during Saturday meeting:
- share tutorials and knowledge
- share information regarding lidar libraries for microRos

TODO through the Week: 
- Try to assembly the entire rover to get a feel/understanding of how everything will look together (Saturday)
	- bring hotglue gun (maybe)
- update the website (bri and misi)
	- update component pics with our own pics
	- add team meeting notes as well
	- add summary of may notes

JULY goal is to create a library with function calls for our sensors
August goal - to have the rover functioning by itself

In charge of components:
Brittney - lidar
Misi - IMU and accelorator 
Jordy - PID encoder
